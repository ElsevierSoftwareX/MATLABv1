# eRDF Analyser - MATLABv1

Latest release: v1.0 [27/02/2017]

eRDF Analyser is an interactive and integrated tool for electron reduced density function analysis. 
This tool allows users to input an electron diffraction pattern (obtained from a TEM) and guides them interactively through the process of fitting and extracting the reduced density function (RDF) for their material.

This tool is available as open source code and in executable form (see Release Downloads) (both covered under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3). Compatibility with versions of MATLAB other than R2015b is not guaranteed, although it has been tested on R2014a-R2016b on Windows/Mac OS.
