2. Amorphous_SiO2_azav_0.00167.txt 	- Amorphous 18nm SiO2 film
					- Azimuthally averaged intensity profile 
					- From diffraction pattern recorded with an off-centred direct beam
					- Use 0.00167 as value for calibration factor

Polycrystalline patterns stated below are NOT the calibration standards used for the amorphous SiO2 diffraction data, but are provided as examples.

3. Polycrystalline_Au_DP-2K.txt		- Polycrystalline diffraction pattern of Au nanoparticles on carbon grid
					- Binned by two from original 4K-by-4K data presented in manuscript due to size restrictions
					- May require masking of distortions (dots in horizontal plane across centre) in addition to beam stop
